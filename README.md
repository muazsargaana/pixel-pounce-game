Pixel Pounce

Description:
I created Pixel Pounce, a 3D endless-runner game inspired by Slope, as part of my Year 10 Game Development elective. Built in Unity using C#, the game features physics-based movement, obstacle spawning, increasing difficulty, and a polished UI. Working on this project helped me understand core game mechanics, object pooling, and real-time rendering.
