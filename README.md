# Pixel Pounce

**A 3D endless-runner game inspired by *Slope*, developed in Year 10 as part of my Game Development elective.**  

Built in Unity using C#, featuring physics-based movement, obstacle spawning, increasing difficulty, and a polished UI. This project helped me understand core game mechanics, object pooling, and real-time rendering.
